**Neural Network Classifier Using Keras 
**
This project implements a multi-layer neural network classifier using Python and TensorFlowâ€™s Keras API. It was developed as part of the CSE 4309 course:

Data Handling: Reads and processes UCI dataset files for training and testing the model. Supports multiple datasets, including "pendigits" and "satellite."

Normalization: Scales input features for better model performance by normalizing data values.

Model: The network uses sigmoid activation functions for hidden layers and outputs.

Training and Evaluation: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy, then trained on the specified dataset.
